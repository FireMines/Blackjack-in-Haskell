# Blackjack_Project


For the final project of the PROG2006 course I chose to create Blackjack with most of the rules they use in Las Vegas' casinos in haskell. 
I chose to recreate Blackjack for a few reasons, one of them are that most people already know the concept of Blackjack and how its played, which makes it easy for people to test out and play. Another reason is because i felt like this was a game that was duable to create in haskell in the amount of time we had and it followed the specifications layed out in the project description. I also felt like Blackjack was a game that suits how haskell works as a language. 

To get the program to run on your computer you first need a few things. You need:

* Haskell downloaded
* A IDE or somewhere to be able to edit your code and run it
* Code in this repo cloned to your computer

After you have made sure you got all the nessesarry stuff what you need to do is open your IDE and the project with its code. You then open a terminal and navigate to the **\blackjack** folder. When you are in this folder, simply write : `stack run` in the terminal. Now your terminal should be cleared and the game has started. Simply follow what is asked on screen and enjoy the game :)

If you wish to run the tests i've implemented in this program, simply navigate in the terminal to the **\test** folder. When you are in this folder, write the command `stack test` and then all the tests should run. You can also do `stack test --coverage` to see how much test coverage ive done for this project.

**NB!** If you need any help at the start of the game, simply juse the flag `help` before entering the game.

**NB2!** This program have only been tested on a Windows 10 desktop because i don't have any other machines avaiable to test it on. If you attempt to run this on a Mac or Linux machine it might be affected by something unknown and not work as intended.
